This notebook contains implementation of some tensorflow basics

Anyone who wants to get start with hands on TF can refer this nb

This part 1 has following basics covered-
1. Initial Installations
2. Basic Tensor operations 
3. Simple NN with Sequential API, Functional API as well as using 
model subclassing
4. Very basic implementation of Simple RNN, LSTM, GRU and Bidirectional LSTM
5. Designing your own custom NN layers 
6. Saving and Loading the models


Part 2 contains:
1. Transfer Learning and fine tuning
2. Tensorflow Datasets
3. Callbacks with Keras and Custom callbacks
4. Custom MODEL.FIT
5. Custom Training Loops
